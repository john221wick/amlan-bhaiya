# Girls are weighed down by restrictions, boys with demands â€“ two equally harmful disciplines

**Introduction**

In the intricate tapestry of human society, the distinct threads of gender roles and expectations weave patterns of disparity and uniformity. Across cultures and countries, including India, gendered upbringing molds individuals from a tender age, creating paradigms that have both overt and subtle impacts on their development and societal integration. This essay delves into the nuanced dynamics of how girls are often shackled by restrictions while boys are burdened with demands, exploring the implications of these gendered disciplines through a lens that is both critical and empathetic. Drawing from a variety of sources, including global reports and the thoughts of renowned thinkers, this analysis endeavors to unravel the complex interplay of gender norms, their manifestations in different societies, and the path forward toward a more egalitarian future.

**Body**

### The Global Context: A Tapestry of Gendered Expectations

The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report highlights a stark reality: no country has yet achieved gender parity. This gap is not merely a measure of economic participation or political empowerment but also reflects deeply ingrained societal norms. In developed countries, despite advancements in gender equality, the remnants of traditional expectations persist. Girls often face a labyrinth of restrictions, from the clothes they wear to the careers they are expected to pursue. Boys, conversely, grapple with the weight of demands - to be strong, to provide, to suppress emotion. Such dichotomies are not only harmful but also stifle the full potential of individuals.

### The Indian Scenario: Amplified Contrasts

In India, the contrast becomes even more pronounced. The patriarchal fabric of the society imposes severe restrictions on girls, curtailing their freedom and autonomy. From restrictions on mobility to the expectation of conforming to roles of caretakers, Indian girls navigate through a thicket of societal norms that limit their opportunities for personal and professional growth. Boys, on the other hand, are saddled with the burden of familial expectations, economic provision, and upholding the family honor, often at the cost of their desires and mental health.

#### Education and Employment: A Gendered Divide

Education in India reflects a microcosm of these gendered disciplines. While boys are encouraged to pursue streams leading to high-paying jobs, girls are often steered towards fields deemed 'suitable' for them. The UNESCO report on global education inequality underscores this, noting that in many parts of the world, including India, girls are less likely to be enrolled in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, attributing this trend to societal norms and expectations.

In the realm of employment, the situation is no less grim. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reports indicate a significant gender gap in labor force participation rates globally, with India exhibiting one of the largest disparities. Women's employment is often seen through the prism of supplementary income rather than essential economic contribution, further entrenching gender stereotypes.

#### Mental Health and Social Expectations

The mental health implications of these gendered expectations are profound. The pressure to conform to societal norms can lead to anxiety, depression, and a host of other mental health issues. For girls, the constant vigilance over their behavior and choices can result in a diminished sense of self-worth. For boys, the relentless demand to adhere to masculine ideals often leads to emotional repression and increased stress. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the critical need to address these issues, emphasizing that mental health is inextricably linked to the broader context of social expectations and gender roles.

### Towards a Progressive Future

The path to dismantling these harmful disciplines lies in a multifaceted approach that includes education, policy reform, and societal change. Encouraging critical thinking and empathy from a young age, revising educational curricula to eliminate gender biases, and implementing policies that promote gender equality in all spheres of life are crucial steps. Moreover, there needs to be a concerted effort to challenge and change societal norms that dictate gender roles, championing a culture that values individuals for their abilities and potentials rather than their conformity to outdated expectations.

**Conclusion**

The dichotomy of restrictions and demands based on gender is a global phenomenon with deep roots in cultural, social, and economic structures. In India, these issues are magnified by the country's unique socio-cultural landscape. Addressing them requires not just policy interventions but a collective shift in mindset. As noted by the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman." This insight underscores the reality that gender roles are socially constructed and can, therefore, be deconstructed and reimagined. Embracing this perspective opens the door to a world where girls and boys are freed from the chains of restrictions and demands, allowing them to explore their full potential. The journey towards such a future is undoubtedly challenging, but it is also filled with the promise of liberation and equality.

# Thinking is like a game, it does not begin unless there is an opposite team

In the vast arena of human intellect, the act of thinking is often compared to a game, a strategic play that necessitates the presence of an opposing force to truly commence. This analogy, rich in its implications, serves as a foundation to explore the dynamics of thought, competition, and collaboration in the contemporary world. The essence of this concept, while universally applicable, finds distinct resonances and contrasts when viewed through the lens of global and Indian contexts.

## Introduction

The notion that "Thinking is like a game, it does not begin unless there is an opposite team" encapsulates the dialectical nature of human thought. It suggests that opposition, in various forms, acts as a catalyst for intellectual engagement and progress. Drawing on the wisdom of thinkers such as Hegel, who emphasized the dialectical process in the evolution of ideas, this essay explores how opposition fuels the game of thought, driving innovation, creativity, and societal progress. Through a comparative analysis of global and Indian examples, this essay aims to unravel the complexities of this analogy, highlighting its implications in a rapidly evolving world.

## Body

The Indian approach to problem-solving, rooted in the principles of "Jugaad" innovation, emphasizes frugal and flexible innovation in the face of constraints. This form of thinking, while different from the competitive model seen in developed countries, is no less dynamic or effective. It is a testament to how diversity and internal opposition can foster a unique ecosystem of innovation, as evidenced by India's burgeoning startup ecosystem, which ranks third globally according to the Nasscom Startup Ecosystem Report.

### Bridging the Gap: Learning from Each Other

The comparison between the global and Indian contexts reveals a spectrum of ways in which the game of thinking is initiated and played, influenced by the nature of the opposing forces. Developed countries often leverage external competition to push the boundaries of what is possible, while India's internal diversity and challenges spur a form of thinking that is adaptive, collaborative, and resilient. Both approaches have their merits and limitations, suggesting that a hybrid model that incorporates competitive drive with collaborative resilience could offer a more holistic pathway to innovation and progress.

### The Role of Education and Policy

Central to nurturing a balanced approach to thinking is the role of education and policy. Educational systems that encourage critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, coupled with policies that foster a competitive yet collaborative ecosystem, can cultivate a culture of innovation that leverages the best of both worlds. For instance, the Finnish education system, renowned for its emphasis on student-centered learning and collaboration, alongside a strong culture of research and development, presents a model worth emulating.

## Conclusion

The analogy that thinking begins with the presence of an opposing force, whether external competition or internal diversity, highlights the multifaceted nature of human intellect and progress. The global perspective, with its focus on competition as a catalyst for innovation, and the Indian context, where diversity and collaboration drive thought, offer valuable insights into the dynamics of thinking as a game. In recognizing the strengths and limitations of each approach, there lies an opportunity to forge a future that embraces both competitive spirit and collaborative wisdom. As we stand at the crossroads of a rapidly changing world, the challenge lies in how we harness the power of opposition, in all its forms, to fuel the game of thought. In doing so, we can aspire to a future that is not only innovative and resilient but also inclusive and harmonious, reflecting the true spirit of a game well played.

Policies that support grassroots innovations, like India's National Innovation Foundation, highlight how recognizing and incentivizing creativity in everyday life can lead to sustainable development and inclusive growth.

### The Digital Age: A Double-Edged Sword

The digital revolution presents a paradox in the quest for creativity in the mundane. On one hand, technology has democratized access to information, enabling anyone with an internet connection to explore and create. On the other hand, the constant bombardment of information can dull the senses to the beauty of the mundane. It is crucial to navigate this digital landscape with mindfulness, ensuring that technology serves as a tool for enhancing creativity, rather than a distraction from the wonders of the everyday world.

## Conclusion

The journey to find the magical in the mundane is both a personal and collective endeavor. It challenges us to look beyond the obvious, to question and reimagine the world around us. This quest for creativity is not confined by geographical boundaries or economic conditions; it is a universal principle that finds unique expressions across different cultures and contexts. The examples from both developed countries and India demonstrate that creativity is not a rarefied domain reserved for the few but a ubiquitous process that thrives on the ordinary.

As we move forward, it is imperative to cultivate an environment that encourages exploration, values curiosity, and rewards the effort to find beauty and potential in the mundane. By doing so, we not only enrich our own lives but also contribute to a world where creativity and innovation are driven by a profound appreciation for the everyday. In the end, the ability to see the magical in the mundane is not just an inspiration for creativity; it is a testament to the human spirit's endless capacity for wonder and transformation.

# There are Better Practices to â€˜Best Practicesâ€™

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of organizational management and policy development, the term 'best practices' has become a beacon for guiding principles that promise efficiency, productivity, and success. Rooted in the quest for excellence, 'best practices' are often heralded as the gold standard for organizations striving to achieve their goals. However, the dynamism of the global economy, coupled with the diversity of cultural and institutional landscapes, suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The assertion that there are better practices to 'best practices' invites a critical examination of this concept, advocating for a more nuanced approach that is adaptable, innovative, and context-specific. This essay delves into the limitations of 'best practices', explores alternative approaches, and underscores the importance of adaptability and innovation, drawing on examples from both developed countries and India, to illustrate the contrast and suggest a path forward.

## Body

### The Limitations of 'Best Practices'

The concept of 'best practices' is often criticized for its inherent assumption that what works best in one context will work equally well in another. This assumption overlooks the unique challenges and opportunities present in different environments. For instance, a Harvard Business Review article highlights the risk of best practices stifling innovation by promoting conformity. Moreover, the World Bank's World Development Report points out the potential of 'best practices' to ignore local knowledge and expertise, leading to solutions that are not fully adapted to the specific needs of a community or organization.

### The Quest for Contextual Adaptation

#### Learning from Developed Countries

In developed countries, there is a growing recognition of the need for practices that transcend the 'best' label to become more inclusive of contextual dynamics. For example, in the healthcare sector, the United States has seen a shift towards personalized medicine, acknowledging that medical interventions must be tailored to individual genetic profiles, lifestyles, and environmental factors. This approach contrasts sharply with the one-size-fits-all strategy often associated with 'best practices'.

#### The Indian Perspective

India, with its vast diversity and socio-economic disparities, presents a compelling case for the adoption of better practices that are rooted in contextual understanding. The success of the Aadhaar project, the world's largest biometric ID system, serves as a testament to this. By recognizing the unique challenge of providing a reliable form of identification to millions of its citizens, India developed a system that is now considered a global benchmark in digital identity verification. This initiative underscores the value of customizing solutions to meet local needs, rather than blindly adopting practices deemed 'best' elsewhere.

### Embracing Innovation and Flexibility

The essence of finding better practices lies in fostering innovation and maintaining flexibility. This is particularly relevant in the face of global challenges such as climate change, where traditional best practices in energy production and consumption are being reevaluated. The transition towards renewable energy sources, exemplified by countries like Germany and Denmark, reflects an innovative approach to addressing environmental concerns, deviating from conventional practices in favor of sustainable solutions.

In India, the innovation in digital payment systems, particularly the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), showcases how technological innovation can lead to practices better suited to the country's unique challenges. By facilitating instant, bank-to-bank transfers via mobile platforms, UPI has revolutionized the payment ecosystem in India, offering a scalable and inclusive model that has garnered international interest.

### Towards a Future of Adaptability and Continuous Learning

The path forward requires a paradigm shift from seeking 'best practices' to cultivating an environment of continuous learning and adaptability. The focus should be on developing practices that are responsive to changing circumstances and can be adjusted as new information becomes available. This approach is supported by the philosophy of thinkers like John Dewey, who advocated for education and learning as processes of active inquiry and adaptation.

## Conclusion

The discourse surrounding 'best practices' often fails to account for the complexity and variability of the real world. As this essay has argued, there are indeed better practices to 'best practices'â€”practices that are adaptable, context-sensitive, and innovative. Drawing on examples from both developed countries and India, it is clear that success in addressing contemporary challenges requires a departure from one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, a more nuanced approach that values local knowledge, encourages innovation, and promotes flexibility is needed. As we move forward, the quest for better practices will necessitate a commitment to continuous learning and an openness to reevaluating established norms. In doing so, we can foster a more inclusive, sustainable, and effective approach to solving the complex problems of our time.
